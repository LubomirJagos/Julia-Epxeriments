Julia Experiments by LuboJ
==========================
I read a lot about julia language and seems to be perfect candidate for my projects targeting digital signal processing to just have fun using RF, I love to do this stuff but there was always problem to implement algorithm and run it on memory limited devices without using all of their resources. So today I decided to try Julia and give it shot if it's really so effective and fast as C/C++, I hope it will not dissapoint me.
